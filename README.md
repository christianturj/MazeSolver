# Maze Solver Robot-HCS12

Autonomous maze solver built as the final microprocessor project (team of four). Implemented in HCS12 assembly using CodeWarrior, the robot follows a guide line, detects intersections, makes decisions, and performs bumper triggered dead-end recovery via a finite-state machine coordinating motors, sensors, and LCD.
